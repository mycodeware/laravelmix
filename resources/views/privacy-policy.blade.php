<p>When you open emails from the Site, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened an email from us, if your computer supports such capabilities.

Additionally, we keep a record of what types of emails you have opted to and not to receive.</p>
<p>Information from Other Sources</p>
<p>We may receive information about you from other sources, including without limitation, Third Party Platforms, and add it to your personal information.</p>
<p>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED</p>
<p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site and through Third Party Platforms, including but not limited to those described below:</p>

In addition, similar and additional information provided to Third Party Platforms may be made available to us as well. If you log in to or access the Site using a third party social media platform, we will have access to certain information from that platform, such as your email address, friends list and profile information.</p>
